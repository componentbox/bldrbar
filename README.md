A component build tool with templates and integrations

### Components <br>
"An individual software component is a software package, a web service, a web resource, or a module that encapsulates a set of related functions (or data).

All system processes are placed into separate components so that all of the data and functions inside each component are semantically related (just as with the contents of classes). Because of this principle, it is often said that components are modular and cohesive." -- Wiki

### Integrations <br>
"The process of bringing together the component sub-systems into one system (an aggregation of subsystems cooperating so that the system is able to deliver the overarching functionality) and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a system, and in information technology as the process of linking together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally, to act as a coordinated whole." -- Wiki

### Templates <br>
"Templates allow one to create content and enable that content to quickly be replicated for multiple uses." -- Wiki
